How We Collect Information<\/strong><\/span><\/h4>\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong>WEBSITE COOKIES<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The website may place \u201ccookies\u201d on a visitor\u2019s computer. Cookies are small text files. Our cookies save anonymized (e.g. Non-Personally Identifiable) data about individual visitors, allowing the website to recognize information about a visitor and help deliver personalized content and other services and functions. The Website may use both session cookies, which terminate when a User closes his or her browser, and persistent cookies, which remain on the User\u2019s computer until they expire or are manually deleted. A cookie does not retrieve any other data from your hard drive.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The Website may also contain coding from our third party business and technology partners, which generate third-party cookies. Third-party cookies allow these third party business and technology partners to store Non-Personally Identifiable Information, which is accessible when you visit the Website or other third party websites. We do not control use of these cookies.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Most browsers allow you to control cookies, including whether or not to accept them, and provide the ability to remove them. You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with your browser. Blocking cookies may result in a lower quality experience for you while you are using the Website, or otherwise stop certain features on the Website from functioning. Blocking cookies does stop all tracking activities described in this Policy.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong>DO NOT TRACK SIGNALS<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Do Not Track is a feature in your web browser, which enables you to ask to optout of the third party tracking of your online activities over time and across third party websites. Third parties cannot collect any Personally Identifiable Information from this Website unless you provide it to them directly.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong>LOG FILES<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Like most websites, our servers utilize log files. Log files store information including internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring\/exit pages, platform type, date\/time stamp, and number of clicks. Log files are used to analyze trends, administer the Website, track Users\u2019 movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. We use log file information at times to help identify you as you browse and to gather broad technical and demographic information on who uses our website.ttr<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong>GOOGLE ANALYTICS ADVERTISING FEATURES<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">We use Google Analytics to collect information about the use of the Website.

We use the information we get from Google Analytics only to improve the Website. Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit the Website, rather than your name or other identifying information. We do not combine the information collected through the use of Google Analytics with Personally Identifiable Information.
